# Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
:navtitle: Role Based Access Control

In the previous section, you learnt how to _authenticate_ users (that is, *who* they are). In this section you will learn how to _authorize_ users to perform actions in RHDH (that is, *what* they can do in RHDH).

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security concept that controls access to resources in a system, and specifies a mapping between _users_ of the system, and the _actions_ they can perform on _resources_ in the system. You define _roles_ with specific _permissions_ , and then assign the roles to users.

RBAC on RHDH is built on top of the *Permissions* framework in Backstage, which defines RBAC policies in code. Rather than define policies in code, the RHDH RBAC feature allows you to define policies in a declarative fashion using a simple CSV based format.

To apply RBAC in RHDH, you need to do two things:

. Configure an authenticated user as a *Policy Administrator*
. Configure policies in a CSV file and import it into RHDH

## Declarative Role Based Access Control

RBAC in RHDH is configured using a CSV file that follows the *casbin* (https://casbin.org) format, a popular declarative domain specific language (DSL) for access control.

A RBAC policy CSV consists of a number of lines of declarations. A *policy* declaration consists of lines in the following format:

[source,csv]
----
type, role_name, resource, action, permission
----
where,

* *type* = should be a single letter - `p` for policy type, or `g` for role assignments to users
* *role_name* = A custom role name defined by you, for example `admins`, `users`, `viewers`
* *resource* = features in RHDH, for example `catalog-entity`, `policy-entity`, `scaffolder-template`, and more
* *action* = `create`, `update`, delete, or `read`
* *permission* = `allow` or `deny`

Consult the references section at the bottom of this page for the full list of `resource` types in RHDH.

Consider the following policy snippet:

[source, csv]
----
p, role:default/myrole, catalog-entity, read, allow
p, role:default/myrole, catalog.entity.delete, delete, deny
g, user:default/myuser, role:default/myrole
----

It defines a custom role named `myrole` that permits read only access to the RHDH catalog, but denies deletes. The last line in the policy CSV file assigns the `myuser` user the `myrole` role. The `myuser` user should be a valid identity that is authenticated by one of the identity providers supported by RHDH.

## Lab: Configure Policy Administrators

NOTE: The main reason to declare policy administrators is to allow a certain limited number of authenticated users to invoke the RBAC REST API. The actual policies are defined in a separate CSV file and referenced in the `app-config-rhdh` ConfigMap. This can be done by OpenShift platform or cluster administrators who have access to the namespace where RHDH is running.

. To declare users as policy administrators, add the following `permission` attribute to the `app-config-rhdh` ConfigMap (At the same indentation level as the *app* and below the *catalog* attribute). Ensure that you added a valid authenticated user for the `admin.users` attribute:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
catalog:
      providers:
        github:
          ...
        githubOrg:
          ...
*permission:
      enabled: true
      rbac:
        admin:
          users:
            - name: user:default/rsriniva*
----

. The RBAC plugin is disabled by default. Enable it by adding it to the list of dynamic plugins in the ConfigMap *dynamic-plugins-rhdh-local*.
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
...
data:
  dynamic-plugins.yaml: |
    includes:
      - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
    plugins:
      - package: './dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github-dynamic'
        disabled: false
      - package: './dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github-org-dynamic'
        disabled: false
      *- package: './dynamic-plugins/dist/janus-idp-backstage-plugin-rbac'
        disabled: false*
----

. Restart rollout of the RHDH pod from the `Topology` view.

. Sign out from the existing RHDH session and log in again using the GitHub ID of the declared policy administrator.

. Navigate to the `Catalog` page in RHDH. Note that the `Create` button is not visible. You are not allowed to create new components.

. Next, try navigating to the `API` page. The `Register` button is not visible. With RBAC enabled, most features are disabled by default. You need to explicitly enable permissions to resources in RHDH.

## Lab: RBAC Administration UI

To selectively allow RHDH features, you need to declare `roles` with allowed policies, and then assign these roles to users or groups. Previous versions of RHDH allowed you to do this using CSV files stored in ConfigMaps. Recent versions of RHDH have introduced a convienient web based UI to manage policies.

This section covers the RBAC Admin UI. Consult the product documentation for the process to manually specify policies using CSV files.

WARNING: It is recommended to keep the RBAC system *disabled* when trying out features and functionality of RHDH like Software Templates, plugins, Search, and more. Turn it back on only if you know what you are doing, and you fully understand the impact of policies.

. After you have enabled the RBAC dynamic plugin and add users to the `rbac.admin.users` list in the `app-config-rhdh` ConfigMap, log in to RHDH and then click `Administration` in the bottom of the left sidebar.

. Notice that a new tab called `RBAC` is now enabled. There is a single role named `rbac_admin` declared with the users you declared in the `rbac.admin.users` list assigned to this role.
+

. Click on the `role:default/rbac_admin` link. The policy details page lists the users assigned to this role in the left column, and the list of permitted policies on the right.
+
image::rbac-policy-details.png[title=RBAC Policy Mapping]
+
This user is allowed to create, edit, update and delete RBAC policies and view catalog items. With RBAC enabled, you need to explicitly allow users to create catalog items.

. Switch back the RBAC `Administration` page. Click `Create` to add a new policy.

. In the `Create Role` screen, enter `allow-catalog-create-policy` as the policy name, and enter a brief description. Click `Next`.

. In the `Add users and groups` screen, select users and groups that should be assigned to this role and click `Next`.

. In the `Add permission policies` screen, select *catalog* in the `Plugin` field, and *catalog.entity.create* in the `Resource type` field. Ensure `Create` is selected in the actions and click `Next`.

. Review your choices and click `Create` to create the policy. 
+

. You should get a confirmation message that the policy creation was successful. Log out and log in as the user to whom you assigned the policy. Navigate to the `Catalog` page. Verify that a `Create` button is now visible. Similarly, click `APIs` and verify that you can see a `Register Existing API` button. This user is now allowed to create catalog items. You can assign permissions to delete and update catalog items in a similar manner using the RBAC Admin UI.

## RBAC REST API

RHDH provides an RBAC REST API that you can use to manage the permissions and roles programmatically. This API can be used to automate the maintenance of RHDH permission policies and roles.

You can perform the following actions with the REST API:

* Retrieve information about all permission policies or specific permission policies, or roles
* Create, update, or delete a permission policy or a role
* Retrieve permission policy information about static plugins

WARNING: If RBAC is enabled, you may need to permit actions on the `policy.entity` resource for read, create and update to view and change policies using the REST API. Recall that the default policy is to deny, so you will see HTTP 401 or 403 errors if you make REST calls without policy changes.

Detailed coverage of the REST API is beyond the scope of this course. Consult the references section for more details.

## Lab: RBAC REST API

. To send requests to the RBAC API, you need a JWT token from RHDH to authenticate yourself. In RHDH, log in as a user who can access RBAC policies, and navigate to the `Catalog` page. Open the browser's developer tools pane (for example, on Chrome Ctrl+Shift+C), and click the `Network` tab. Look for HTTP requests like `entity-facets?facet=kind` and click on that entry. In the `Request Headers` section look for the `Authorization` entry. Copy the token value to the clipboard.
+
image::rbac-token.png[title=Get the Bearer token for the logged in RHDH user]

. Save the token value and RHDH URL to environment variables:
+
```bash
$ export token=<your token value>
$ export RHDH_URL=https://backstage-rhdh-devhub.apps.cluster-<guid>.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io
```

. Use the `curl` and `jq` CLI tools, or a REST API client, to invoke the RBAC REST API. For example, to list the policies existing in the current RHDH instance:
+
```bash
$ curl $RHDH_URL/api/permission/roles \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
  -k -s | jq .
