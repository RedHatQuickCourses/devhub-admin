# Basics of Red Hat Developer Hub Configuration
:navtitle: Basic Configuration

Recall that RHDH is deployed as an immutable container on OpenShift. Upgrading RHDH to new versions deploys a new container, so the configuration is maintained outside the container as YAML files, which are parsed at container start up and the state persisted to the PostgreSQL database used by RHDH.

RHDH uses a number of different YAML files for configuration. Various runtime variables, plugin configuration, and other behaviors can be controlled using these YAML configuration files.

NOTE: The sections in this chapter assume you have installed RHDH using the operator. If you used a Helm chart for installation, the configuration should more or less work with minimal changes. Consult the product documentation for details.

== Exploring the default RHDH Configuration

Let us briefly inspect the OpenShift resources created by the RHDH operator after installation.

Log in as the OpenShift cluster administrator user in the web console and switch to the *Developer* perspective.
Click on `Topology` in the left sidebar, and then expand the hamburger menu (three vertical dots) next to the `rhdh` Backstage custom resource (CR) to select the `Edit Backstage` option

In the `Backstage details` page, click the `Resources` tab to view the resources created by the operator installation.

image::rhdh-op-resources.png[title=Resources created by the operator]

The two `ConfigMap` resources, *backstage-dynamic-plugins-rhdh* and *backstage-appconfig-rhdh* are used to configure the dynamic plugins, and the overall configuration of RHDH respectively.

The *default.app-config.yaml* configuration stored in the *backstage-appconfig-rhdh* ConfigMap is as follows:

[subs=+quotes]
----
data:
  default.app-config.yaml: |
    backend:
      auth:
        keys:
          # This is a default value, which you should change by providing your own app-config
          - secret: "pl4s3Ch4ng3M3"
----

IMPORTANT: This  *default.app-config.yaml* section should not be edited directly to avoid problems during operator upgrades. Instead you must define your own custom *app-config-rhdh.yaml* configuration file as a separate ConfigMap resource, and override the default configuration values.

== Application Configuration Files (app-config-*.yaml)

Recall that an instance of RHDH is called an "App" (short form of _Application_), and the instance is configured using YAML files. RHDH runs as a container on OpenShift, so this and other configuration files for RHDH should be created as OpenShift _ConfigMaps_ and mounted inside the container.

[WARNING]
====
Do NOT hard code sensitive and confidential values in the *app-config.yaml* files! Instead, use environment variable placeholders. You can then store plain text values using _ConfigMaps_ and confidential values like passwords, API keys, encrypted tokens and other sensitive information using _Secrets_.
====

The configuration is validated using JSON Schema definitions. You can enable or disable components and plugins, and configure them using these `app-config-*.yaml` files.
The configuration is shared between the frontend and backend. Values that are common between the two needs to be defined only once, for example, the `backend.baseUrl`, which defines the root URL of the backend REST API.

Configuration is stored in YAML files where the defaults are *app-config.yaml* and *app-config.local.yaml* for locally overriding configuration variables from the default configuration file. Other sets of files can by loaded by passing `--config` flags.

It is possible to have multiple configuration files, to support different environments (Development, QA, Staging, Production, and more), and also to override configuration that is for specific components and plugins. The configuration files to load are selected using a `--config` flag, and it is possible to load any number of files.

If no `--config` flags are specified, the default behavior is to load *app-config.yaml*. Note that if any `--config` flags are used, the default *app-config.yaml* file is *NOT* loaded. To include it, you need to explicitly pass it as `--config` arguments, for example:

The RHDH container image uses an entrypoint defined as follows for starting the backend container:

[subs=+quotes]
----
node packages/backend 
  --config app-config.yaml \
  --config app-config.example.yaml \
  --config app-config.example.production.yaml
----

It is also possible to supply configuration through environment variables, for example, consider the YAML configuration snippet like below:

[subs=+quotes]
----
app:
  baseUrl: https://${HOST}
----

You can override the value of `baseUrl` by passing an environment variable named *APP_CONFIG_app_baseUrl*=https://staging.example.com to the RHDH container.  
The environment variable name must be prefixed with *APP_CONFIG* and the nested YAML attributes separated with underscore("_") symbol.

WARNING: This approach should be used sparingly, usually just for temporary overrides during development.

== Configuration File Precedence

Configuration methods have different priority, higher priority methods replace values from configurations with lower priority.
The priority of the configurations is determined by the following rules, in order:

. Configuration from the *APP_CONFIG_* environment variables has the highest priority, followed by files.
. Files loaded with `--config` flags are ordered by priority, where the last flag has the highest priority.
. If no `--config` flags are provided, *app-config.local.yaml* has higher priority than *app-config.yaml*.

== Lab: Adding a Custom app-config YAML File

It is a good practice to override the *default.app-config.yaml* file using your own custom configuration file embedded inside a ConfigMap, and passing it as an argument using `--config` flags. At runtime, the values from the default configuration are merged with the values from your custom configuration file.

To create the custom configuration file, do the following:

. Create a new ConfigMap named *app-config-rhdh* resource in the same OpenShift project where you installed RHDH (*devhub*).

.. Click on `ConfigMap` -> click `Create ConfigMap`
+
image::create_config.png[title=ConfigMap]

.. Select `YAML` view and paste the following YAML snippet.
+
[subs=+quotes]

kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: app-config-rhdh
data:
  "app-config-rhdh.yaml": |
    app:
      title: Red Hat Developer Hub
      baseUrl: *https://backstage-rhdh-devhub.apps.cluster-<guid>.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io* <1>
    backend:
      auth:
        keys:
          - secret: *"${BACKEND_SECRET}"* <2>
      baseUrl: *https://backstage-rhdh-devhub.apps.cluster-<guid>.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io* <1>
      cors:
        origin: *https://backstage-rhdh-devhub.apps.cluster-<guid>.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io* <1>
----
<1> The RHDH URL. Replace *guid* with your unique guid from RHDP
<2> A secret to define the mandatory RHDH backend authentication key

. Click `Create` to create the ConfigMap.

. The custom application configuration file contains a sensitive environment variable, named *BACKEND_SECRET*. This variable contains a mandatory backend authentication key that Developer Hub uses to reference an environment variable defined in an OpenShift Container Platform secret. You must create a secret, named *rhdh-secrets*, and reference it in the Developer Hub CR. 

.. Click `Secrets > Create -> Key/value secret`:
+
image::secret.png[title=Create Secret]

.. Enter *rhdh-secrets* in the `Secret name` field, enter *BACKEND_SECRET* in the `Key` field. For the *Value* field, open a new command line terminal and generate a base64 encoded string using the following command:
+
```bash
$ node -p 'require("crypto").randomBytes(24).toString("base64")'
```

.. Copy the randomly generated string to the *Value* field, and then click `Create` to create the secret.
+
image::random.png[title=Create a new secret]

. Now that you have created your own custom configuration file with an embedded secret, you need to reference the new custom configuration file in the backstage custom resource (CR) and restart the RHDH container for the changes to take effect. Click on `Topology` in the left sidebar, and then expand the hamburger menu (three vertical dots) next to the `rhdh` Backstage custom resource (CR) to select the `Edit Backstage` option
+
image::edit-backstage-cr.png[title=Edit Backstage CR]

. Reference the `app-config-rhdh` ConfigMap and the `rhdh-secrets` secret in the CR:

. Click `Save` to save the changes to the Backstage CR.

. Switch to the `Topology` view, and expand the menu next to the `backstage-rhdh` pod. Click `Restart rollout` to restart the RHDH pod.
+
image::restart-rollout.png[title=Restart RHDH pod to re-read configuration value changes]
+
Wait for the RHDH pod to restart (It may take a few minutes). Ensure that the pod is restarted without any errors.

. To troubleshoot failed startup, click on the `backstage-rhdh` pod, and then click the `Resources` tab. Click `View logs` to view the pod logs.
+
image::logs.png[title=View Pod logs]

.. Ensure that you correctly indent the CR yaml file when referencing the secret and ConfigMap. Incorrect indentation may cause the pod restart to fail.

Throughout the rest of the course, you will edit the *app-config-rhdh* ConfigMap to configure and enable plugins for RHDH.

Whenever you change the configuration in the `app-config-rhdh` ConfigMap, or create/edit any new secrets, you can force RHDH to re-read the configuration by clicking on the RHDH pod in the `Topology` page and then selecting `Restart rollout`.

You can also scale down the RHDH pod to zero (0), and then scale it up back to one or more to reload the configuration.
