:navtitle: Upgrading RHDH

Upgrading RHDH depends on your install method that you selected.

IMPORTANT: Before you perform any updates to RHDH, ensure that you back up *ALL* the data in the RHDH PostreSQL database, plus any RHDH configuration stored in ConfigMaps and Secrets!

== Upgrading the RHDH Helm Chart

You can update RHDH using the OpenShift web console.

. Ensure that you are in the *Developer* perspective of the OpenShift console. Click on `Helm` to view the installed releases in the `Helm Releases` tab.

. Expand the hamburger menu on the right of the `rhdh` release and click `Upgrade`.

. In the `Upgrade Helm Release` page, select the version of RHDH you want to upgrade to in the `Chart version` drop-down. This list shows the different helm chart versions of RHDH that have been publicly released.

. After you have selected a version for upgrade, click `Upgrade`. Wait for 10-15 minutes while the resources in the older versions are deleted, and newer versions of the RHDH pod(s) are launched.

. Close all open RHDH web pages, and log in again to verify that the upgrade was successful.

== Upgrading the RHDH Helm Chart using the CLI

You can update RHDH using the *helm* CLI.

. Log in to the OpenShift cluster as the cluster administrator. For this, select 'admin' -> 'Copy login command' and select "Display Token".

You can also supply extra values to the chart by creating a *new-values.yml* file on your workstation with values that override the attributes in the installed chart, or add new attributes.

== Upgrading the RHDH Operator using the OpenShift Web Console

The default setting during operator install is set to *Automatic* mode. In this mode, new versions of the operator are _automatically_ downloaded and applied. If you chose the *Manual* mode, a cluster administrator needs to _manually_ approve each upgrade. In such cases, switch to the `Administrator` perspective, and then click on `Operators > Installed Operators` to view the updates for the RHDH operator.

Click `Upgrade Available` for the RHDH operator, and then click `Preview InstallPlan`. Click `Approve` to approve the update.
