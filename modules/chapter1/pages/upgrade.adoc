= Upgrading Red Hat Developer Hub
:navtitle: Upgrading RHDH

Upgrading RHDH depends on your install method that you selected.

IMPORTANT: Before you perform any updates to RHDH, ensure that you back up *ALL* the data in the RHDH PostreSQL database!

== Backup the RHDH PostgreSQL Database

You need to install several CLI tools on your *local workstation* before upgrading the database.

* Install the OpenShift CLI tool *oc*
* Install the PostgreSQL CLI client *psql* and *pg_dump*

=== Backup Process

. Use the *oc* CLI to log in to the OpenShift cluster as the cluster administrator, and switch to the *devhub* project.
+
```bash
$ oc login -u admin https://api.cluster-<your_guid>.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io:6443
$ oc project devhub
```

. Scale the *rhdh-developer-hub* pods to *0* to prevent requests from modifying the database state during backup.
+
```bash
$ oc scale --replicas=0 deployment/rhdh-developer-hub
```

. Get the name of the PostgreSQL database pod and set it to an environment variable.
+
```bash
$ POD=`oc get pods --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=postgresql \
  -o custom-columns=name:.metadata.name --no-headers`; echo $POD
```

. List the RHDH databases in the PostgreSQL instance. The RHDH databases are prefixed by *backstage_*.
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *oc rsh $POD*
sh-5.1$ *psql postgres*
psql (15.3)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# *\l*
...
 backstage_plugin_app
 backstage_plugin_auth
 backstage_plugin_catalog
 backstage_plugin_scaffolder
 backstage_plugin_search 
...
(8 rows)
postgres=# *\q*
sh-5.1$ *exit*
----

. Enable port forwarding to the database pod.
+
```bash
$ oc port-forward $POD 5432:5432
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:5432 -> 5432
Forwarding from [::1]:5432 -> 5432
```

. Backup all the *backstage_* the databases using the *pg_dump* command. Store the database backups in a safe location, for restoration at a later point in time in case of a disaster or failure.
+
```bash
$ pg_dump backstage_plugin_app > /tmp/backstage_plugin_app.sql \
  --host=127.0.0.1 --port=5432 -U postgres
```
+
Repeat the command for all the other *backstage_* databases.

. After all the databases have been backed up, you can scale the *rhdh-developer-hub* back to your original count.
+
```bash
$ oc scale --replicas=1 deployment/rhdh-developer-hub
```

NOTE: If you are using a non-default (that is, from a third party or commercial vendor) PostgreSQL database, refer to the backup instructions from the provider of the PostgreSQL database. Ensure that you scale the *rhdh-developer-hub* pod count to *0* before starting the backup procedure.

== Upgrading the RHDH Helm Chart

You can update RHDH using the OpenShift web console.

. Ensure that you are in the *Developer* perspective of the OpenShift console. Click on `Helm` to view the installed releases in the `Helm Releases` tab.

. Expand the hamburger menu on the right of the `rhdh` release and click `Upgrade`.
+

. In the `Upgrade Helm Release` page, select the version of RHDH you want to upgrade to in the `Chart version` drop-down. This list shows the different helm chart versions of RHDH that have been publicly released.
+

. After you have selected a version for upgrade, click `Upgrade`. Wait for 10-15 minutes while the resources in the older versions are deleted, and newer versions of the RHDH pod(s) are launched.

. Close all open RHDH web pages, and log in again to verify that the upgrade was successful.

== Upgrading the RHDH Helm Chart using the CLI

You can update RHDH using the *helm* CLI.

. Log in to the OpenShift cluster as the cluster administrator. Ensure that you switch to the *devhub* project.
+
```bash
$ oc login -u admin https://api.cluster-<your_guid>.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io:6443
$ oc project devhub
```

. Assuming there is a new version of the RHDH helm chart (for example, *1.1.0*), run the following command to upgrade RHDH. You can also supply extra values to the chart by creating a *new-values.yml* file on your workstation with values that override the attributes in the installed chart, or add new attributes.
+
```bash
$ helm upgrade -i rhdh -f new-values.yml \
  openshift-helm-charts/redhat-developer-hub --version 1.1.0
```
 
== Upgrading the RHDH Operator using the OpenShift Web Console

NOTE: The operator is not yet available publicly (ETA: Q1 2024). Watch this section for updates once the operator is GA.

You can refer to the instructions https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.html#olm-upgrading-operators[here^] to upgrade the RHDH operator.
