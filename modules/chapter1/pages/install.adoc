= Installation

Red Hat builds and ships RHDH as a container image that is based on the _Red Hat Enterprise Linux Universal Base Image_ (**RHEL UBI**).

There are several ways to install RHDH on OpenShift.

== Installation Using the RHDH Operator

RHDH can be installed from within the OpenShift web console just like any other operator from `OperatorHub`.

Refer to the instructions https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/operators/admin/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.html[here^] to install the RHDH operator on OpenShift.

NOTE: At the time of writing (Dec 2023), the operator is not yet available on OperatorHub. Watch this space for install instructions in the near future when the operator becomes generally available (ETA: Q1 2024).

== Installation Using Helm Charts

The Red Hat Developer Hub helm chart is available in the `Helm Catalog` in Openshift, and on https://artifacthub.io[ArtifactHUB^] (A repository of Helm Charts).

A short refresher on how to work with Helm Charts on OpenShift is https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/building_applications/working-with-helm-charts[here^].

The source code, templates, and the `values.yaml` file for the helm chart are available https://github.com/janus-idp/helm-backstage/tree/main[here^] for inspection.
The chart contains an opinionated default configuration of Backstage with a pre-integrated set of useful plugins, and it also uses a PostgreSQL database to persist the configuration state of RHDH.

The Helm chart option is the most up to date and recommended method of installation currently. In this course, you will use the `Red Hat Developer Hub` helm chart to install RHDH.

== Lab: Installation using Helm Charts

=== Pre-requisites

The container image for RHDH is not yet publicly available. You need access to the private repository for RHDH located in the Quay.io container registry.

. If you do not already have one, create a new account at http://quay.io
. Send email to rhdh-interest@redhat.com with your Quay.io ID. Request your ID to be added to the private repository for RHDH
. For support issues and troubleshooting, verify that you have access to the RHDH slack channel at https://redhat-external.slack.com/archives/C05E30GJ79V
. Order the https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod/openshift-cnv.ocp413-single-node-cnv.prod&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link[OpenShift 4.13 Single Node Workshop^] catalog item from Red Hat Demo Platform (RHDP). It should take an hour approximately for the classroom to be fully provisioned. You will receive an email with the details on how to access the OpenShift cluster. Verify that you can log in to the OpenShift web console as a cluster administrator.

=== Before Installation

The pre-release version of the RHDH container image is not yet available publicly for download. You first need to request access to the private container image repository in Quay.io as outlined in the `Pre-requisites` section above.

You then need to create an OpenShift secret with your Quay.io access token (encrypted). Do the following before the RHDH install:

1. Log in your your Quay.io account and click `Account Settings`.
+
image::01_quay-ac-settings.png[title=Quay.io settings]

2. In the `Docker CLI Password` section, click `Generate Encrypted Password`.
+
image::02_generate-enc-pwd.png[title=Generate encrypted token]

3. You will now see your username and encrypted password credentials to log in to Quay.io from Docker or Podman CLI.
Copy the details for use later in the course.
+
image::02-gen-username-password.png[title=Encrypted credentials]

4. Click on `Kubernetes Secret` and download the `<username>-secret.yml` file, where `username` is your Quay.io user ID.
+
image::03_generate-kube-secret.png[title=Kubernetes secret YAML file]
+
You will use the contents of this YAML file in the installation to create an OpenShift secret.

=== Installation using the OpenShift Console

. Log in to your OpenShift web console as the cluster administrator user (usually username is `admin`). The username and password details for your OpenShift cluster are accessible in the RHDP `Services` dashboard. You should have also received an email with the details of your OpenShift cluster.
+
image::03-rhdp-cluster-details.png[title=RHDP OpenShift Cluster Details]
+
[NOTE]
====
You can install the RHDH Helm chart as a regular, non-cluster administrator user, but this is not recommended. Many organizations have strict policies on who can install operators and charts in the OpenShift cluster.
====

. Click on `Projects` (Ensure you are in the `Administrator` perspective of the OpenShift console). Create a new OpenShift project named `devhub`.
+
image::new-ocp-project.png[title=Create a new OpenShift Project]

. Create a new secret in the `devhub` project.

.. Click the `+` icon in the top right corner of the OpenShift console, and paste the contents of the `<username-secret.yaml>` file you downloaded earlier from Quay.io.
+
image::import-yaml-icon.png[title=Import YAML icon]

.. Edit the `metadata.name` attribute and change it to `rhdh-pull-secret`.
+
image::edit-secret-yaml.png[title=Edit Secret YAML file]
+
Click `Create` to create the secret.

. Switch to the `Developer` perspective in the OpenShift console.
+
image::switch-dev-perspective.png[title=Switch to the Developer Perspective]

. Click `+Add` in the left side navigation bar of the `Developer` perspective, and then select `Helm Chart`
+
image::add-helm-chart.png[title=Add Helm Chart]

. Search for `"developer hub"` in the search field on this page, and then select the `Red Hat Developer Hub` chart.
+
image::search-devhub-chart.png[title=Search for RHDH Helm Chart]

. In the `Red Hat Developer Hub` chart page, click `Create`. You will see the `Create Helm Release` page with some fields that need to be edited.

.. Change the `Release Name` to `rhdh`. Ensure that the latest helm chart is selected in the `Chart version` drop-down (As of Dec 2023, latest RHDH version is 0.2).

.. Expand `Root Schema > global` and change the first field value from `apps.example.com` to the wildcard domain name of your OpenShift cluster. In RHDP, it is in the format `apps.cluster-<guid>.dynamic.opentlc.com`, where `<guid>` is unique to your provisioned OpenShift cluster.

.. The final screen should look like the following:
+
image::edit-helm-chart-values.png[title=Edit Helm Chart Details]

.. Click `Create` to deploy the helm chart.

. Wait for 10-15 minutes while the helm chart is deployed. The `PostgreSQL` and `Red Hat Developer Hub` should be fully started.
Click the `Open URL` link to access Red Hat Developer Hub.
+
image::rhdh-installed.png[RHDH Topology View]

. You should now see the Red Hat Developer Hub log in page.
+
image::rhdh-homepage.png[title=RHDH Log in Page]

. Click `ENTER` in the `Guest` card to log in as a guest user. You will configure RHDH to authenticate against GitHub and other identity providers in later chapters of this course.
+
image::rhdh-guest-user.png[title=Log in as a guest user]
+
You have now successfully installed Red Hat Developer Hub on your OpenShift cluster.

== Installation using Helm CLI

IMPORTANT: You must complete the steps listed in the *Before Installation* section before using the steps below.

You will need to install the `helm` CLI. You can download the *helm* and other CLI tools from the OpenShift web console by clicking the *"?"* icon on the top right navigation bar.

=== CLI Install Steps

. Add the OpenShift helm chart repository
+
```bash
$ helm repo add openshift-helm-charts https://charts.openshift.io/
```

. Download the default *values.yaml* file for the RHDH helm chart
+
```bash
$ helm show values openshift-helm-charts/redhat-developer-hub > values.yaml
```

. Change the value of the *global.clusterRouterBase* attribute to the wildcard OpenShift DNS name, and also edit the *upstream.nameOverride* to *rhdh*.
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
global:
  clusterRouterBase: *apps.cluster-<guid>.dynamic.opentlc.com*
  host: ""

upstream:
  nameOverride: *rhdh*

A short refresher on working with helm charts on OpenShift is available https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/building_applications/working-with-helm-charts[here^].

More details about the RHDH helm chart are available at https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/openshift/developer-hub.

== RHDH PostgreSQL Database

[WARNING] 
====
The default installation of RHDH (for both Helm Charts and Operator based installs) deploys a single PostgreSQL 15 database pod. This is a potential single point of failure and could prevent RHDH from being highly available.

You should deploy a cluster of PostgreSQL instances using a suitable operator that provides high availability. Refer to https://www.crunchydata.com/products/crunchy-postgresql-for-openshift[crunchydata^], https://portworx.com/blog/run-ha-postgresql-red-hat-openshift[portworx^], and https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/openshift[EnterpriseDB^] for high availability PostgreSQL database options on OpenShift.

You should follow the installation instructions and install the default single instance PostgreSQL to complete the install. You can then configure the RHDH container to integrate with a clustered PostgreSQL database instance, and delete the default PostgreSQL instance. The details of the configuration are covered in _Chapter 2_ of this course.
====

== Installation Troubleshooting

The following are some problems you could see during installation, and the potential fix for them.

. *Problem*: The `rhdh-developer-hub` pod is stuck in a `CrashLoopBackOff` error with the following seen in the logs:
+
```
Loaded config from app-config-from-configmap.yaml, env
...
2023-07-24T19:44:46.223Z auth info Configuring "database" as KeyStore provider
type=plugin
Backend failed to start up Error: Missing required config value at
'backend.database.client'
```
+
*Solution*: This is happening because the configuration files are not being appropriately accessed by the RHDH container. You may have edited the helm chart values before installation, and one or more attributes are missing or configured incorrectly. It is recommended to keep the default values (except for the wildcard DNS name of the OpenShift cluster) during installation. 
+
You can always edit and update the RHDH configuration after the installation is completed successfully.

. *Problem*: I see the following errors when installing the RHDH helm chart:

* Error: ImagePullBackOff
* Error: ErrImagePull
* Failed to pull image "quay.io/rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9:1.0-88": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = reading manifest 1.0-88 in quay.io/rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9: unauthorized: access to the requested resource is not authorized
+
image::rhdh-pod-details-error.png[title=RHDH Pod Failure]
+
*Solution*: Verify that you have created a secret named `rhdh-pull-secret` in the same project where you are installing RHDH. Delete the failed helm release and re-run the installation steps after you have created the secret.
+
You will also see similar errors if your Quay.io username has not been added to the RHDH private container registry, or if your secret contains an invalid token. Complete the steps outlined in the `Pre-requisites` section and retry the installation steps.

. *Problem*: I see the following error when installing the RHDH helm chart using the *helm* CLI:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
Error: query: failed to query with labels: secrets is forbidden: User "system:anonymous" cannot list resource "secrets" in API group "" in the namespace "devhub"
----
+
*Solution*: Ensure that you are logged in to the OpenShift cluster as a cluster administrator before installing, removing or upgrading the RHDH helm chart. Also ensure that you are in the correct OpenShift project to ensure the resources are created in the correct OpenShift project.
