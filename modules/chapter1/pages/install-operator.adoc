= Red Hat Developer Hub Installation using OperatorHub
:navtitle: Installing RHDH (Operator)

Red Hat provides a fully supported operator for RHDH in the OpenShift *OperatorHub*, which provides a convenient, easy to use web based user interface for installing RHDH.

== Installation Using the RHDH Operator

RHDH can be installed from within the OpenShift web console just like any other operator from `OperatorHub`.

Refer to the instructions https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.1/html/administration_guide_for_red_hat_developer_hub/proc-install-operator_admin-rhdh#proc-install-operator_admin-rhdh[here^] to install the RHDH operator on OpenShift.

== Lab: Installation using RHDH Operator

=== Pre-requisites

. Order the https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?search=single&item=babylon-catalog-prod%2Fopenshift-cnv.ocpmulti-single-node-cnv.prod[OpenShift Single Node Cluster^] catalog item from Red Hat Demo Platform (RHDP). It should take an hour approximately for the classroom to be fully provisioned. You will receive an email with the details on how to access the OpenShift cluster. Verify that you can log in to the OpenShift web console as a cluster administrator.

. Download the OpenShift client `oc` for your platform from from the OpenShift web console by clicking the "?" icon on the top right navigation bar. Uncompress the archive file, and then copy the `oc` binary for your platform to the system path (usually /usr/local/bin on UNIX systems).

=== Create a Project for RHDH

1. Log in to your OpenShift web console as the cluster administrator user (usually username is `admin`). The username and password details for your OpenShift cluster are accessible in the RHDP `Services` dashboard. You should have also received an email with the details of your OpenShift cluster.

2. Create a new OpenShift project named *devhub*. You will install the RHDH operator and instance into this project.

=== Install the RHDH Operator

. Download the installation script to create the RHDH Operator CatalogSource in your cluster.
+
```bash
$ curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-operator/main/.rhdh/scripts/install-rhdh-catalog-source.sh
$ chmod +x install-rhdh-catalog-source.sh
```

. Execute the installation script by running the script with the mentioned parameters:
+
```bash
$ ./install-rhdh-catalog-source.sh --latest --install-operator rhdh
```

. Select `Operators` and click `Installed Operator`, to confirm operator is installedcreate a new RHDH instance.

. On the same page, click `Create instance` to create a new RHDH instance.
+

. In the `Create Backstage` page, change the `Name` to *rhdh*, leave all other fields at default values, and then click `Create` to deploy a new RHDH instance.
+

. Switch to the `Developer` perspective in the OpenShift web console, and select the `rhdh-operator` project and click on `Topology`. Verify that a new instance called `rhdh` is seen with two pods in running state.

. Click the `Open URL` link to access Red Hat Developer Hub.
+

. You should now see the Red Hat Developer Hub log in page.
+

. Click `Enter` in the `Guest` card to log in as a guest user. You will a warning message pop up with the text `Failed to sign in as a guest using the auth backend. Do you want to fallback to the legacy guest token?`. Click `Yes` to log in as a guest user.
You will configure RHDH to authenticate against GitHub and other identity providers in later chapters of this course.

You have now successfully installed Red Hat Developer Hub on your OpenShift cluster using the RHDH operator.

== RHDH PostgreSQL Database

[WARNING]
====
The default installation of RHDH (for both Helm Charts and Operator based installs) deploys a single PostgreSQL 15 database pod. This is a potential single point of failure and could prevent RHDH from being highly available.

You should follow the installation instructions and install the default single instance PostgreSQL to complete the installation. You can then configure the RHDH container to integrate with an external PostgreSQL database instance using the instructions provided in the product documentation at https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.4/html/administration_guide_for_red_hat_developer_hub/assembly-configuring-external-postgresql-databases#proc-configuring-postgresql-instance-using-helm_assembly-install-rhdh-ocp[Configuring an external PostgreSQL instance using the Helm Chart^].
