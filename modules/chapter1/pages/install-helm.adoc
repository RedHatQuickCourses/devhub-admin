= Red Hat Developer Hub Installation using Helm Charts
:navtitle: Installing RHDH (Helm Charts)

Red Hat builds and ships RHDH as a container image that is based on the _Red Hat Enterprise Linux Universal Base Image_ (**RHEL UBI**).

There are several ways to install RHDH on OpenShift. This section covers installation using *Helm* charts. The next section covers installation using the RHDH *Operator* from *OperatorHub*.

== Installation Using Helm Charts

The Red Hat Developer Hub helm chart is available in the `Helm Catalog` in Openshift, and on https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/openshift/redhat-developer-hub[ArtifactHUB^] (A repository of Helm Charts).

A short refresher on how to work with Helm Charts on OpenShift is https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.15/html/building_applications/working-with-helm-charts[here^].

The source code, templates, and the `values.yaml` file for the helm chart are available https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-chart[here^] for inspection.
The chart contains an opinionated default configuration of Backstage with a pre-integrated set of useful plugins, and it also uses a PostgreSQL database to persist the configuration state of RHDH.

== Lab: Installation using Helm Charts

=== Pre-requisites

. Order the https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?search=single&item=babylon-catalog-prod%2Fopenshift-cnv.ocpmulti-single-node-cnv.prod[OpenShift Single Node Cluster^] catalog item from Red Hat Demo Platform (RHDP). It should take approximately an *hour* for the classroom to be fully provisioned. You will receive an email with the details on how to access the OpenShift cluster. Verify that you can log in to the OpenShift web console as a cluster administrator.

=== Create a Project for RHDH

1. Log in to your OpenShift web console as the cluster administrator user (usually username is `admin`). The username and password details for your OpenShift cluster are accessible in the RHDP `Services` dashboard. You should have also received an email with the details of your OpenShift cluster.

+
[NOTE]
====
You can install the RHDH Helm chart as a regular, non-cluster administrator user, but this is not recommended. Many organizations have strict policies on who can install operators and charts in the OpenShift cluster.
====

2. Click on `Home > Projects` (Ensure you are in the `Administrator` perspective of the OpenShift console). Click `Create Project`, and then create a new OpenShift project named `devhub`.
+

=== Install the RHDH Helm Chart

. Create a chart repo for installing RHDH v.14 by executing the following command:
+
```bash
$ oc apply -f https://github.com/rhdh-bot/openshift-helm-charts/raw/redhat-developer-hub-1.4-123-CI/installation/rhdh-next-ci-repo.yaml
helmchartrepository.helm.openshift.io/rhdh-next-ci-repo created
```

. Switch to the `Developer` perspective in the OpenShift console and select the `devhub` project.
+
image::switch-dev-perspective.png[title=Switch to the Developer Perspective]

. Click `+Add` in the left side navigation bar of the `Developer` perspective, and then select `Helm Chart`
+
image::add-helm-chart.png[title=Add Helm Chart]

. Search for `"developer hub"` in the search field on this page, and then select the `Red Hat Developer Hub` chart.
+
image::rhdh14.png[title=Search for RHDH Helm Chart]

. In the `Red Hat Developer Hub` chart page, click `Create`. You will see the `Create Helm Release` page with some fields that need to be edited.

.. Change the `Release Name` to `rhdh`. Ensure that the latest helm chart is selected in the `Chart version` drop-down (As of Jun 2024, latest RHDH version is 1.4).

.. Expand `Root Schema > global` and change the first field value from `apps.example.com` to the wildcard domain name of your OpenShift cluster. In RHDP, it is in the format `apps.cluster-<guid>.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io`, where `<guid>` is unique to your provisioned OpenShift cluster.

.. The final screen should look like the following:
+
image::rhdhcreate.png[title=Edit Helm Chart Details]

.. Click `Create` to deploy the helm chart.

. Wait for 10-15 minutes while the helm chart is deployed. The `PostgreSQL` and `Red Hat Developer Hub` pods should be fully started (dark blue circles around the icons).
Click the `Open URL` link to access Red Hat Developer Hub.
+
image::rhdh-installed.png[title=RHDH Topology View]

. You should now see the Red Hat Developer Hub log in page.
+
image::rhdh-homepage.png[title=RHDH Log in Page]

. Click `Enter` in the `Guest` card to log in as a guest user. You will see a warning message pop up with the text `Failed to sign in as a guest using the auth backend. Do you want to fallback to the legacy guest token?`. Click `Yes` to log in as a guest user.
You will configure RHDH to authenticate against GitHub and other identity providers in later chapters of this course.
+
image::rhdh-guest-user.png[title=Log in as a guest user]
+
You have now successfully installed Red Hat Developer Hub on your OpenShift cluster.

== Installation using Helm CLI

Download the *helm* and *oc* CLI tools from the OpenShift web console by clicking the *"?"* icon on the top right navigation bar. Uncompress the archive files, and then copy the *oc* and *helm* binaries for your platform to the system path (usually `/usr/local/bin` on UNIX systems).

=== CLI Install Steps

. Use curl to download the installation script and make it executable:
+
```bash
$ curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhdh-bot/openshift-helm-charts/redhat-developer-hub-1.4-123-CI/installation/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh
```

. Execute the installation script by running the script with the mentioned parameters:
+
```bash
$ ./install.sh 1.4-123-CI --namespace rhdh-1-4-123-ci --chartrepo
Now using project "rhdh-1-4-123-ci" on server "https://api.cluster-zv42l.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app ruby~https://github.com/sclorg/ruby-ex.git

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=gcr.io/hello-minikube-zero-install/hello-node

== RHDH PostgreSQL Database

[WARNING]
====
The default installation of RHDH (for both Helm Charts and Operator based installs) deploys a single PostgreSQL 15 database pod. This is a potential single point of failure and could prevent RHDH from being highly available.

You should follow the installation instructions and install the default single instance PostgreSQL to complete the install. You can then configure the RHDH container to integrate with an external PostgreSQL database instance using the instructions provided in the product documentation at https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.2/html/administration_guide_for_red_hat_developer_hub/assembly-configuring-external-postgresql-databases#proc-configuring-postgresql-instance-using-helm_admin-rhdh[Configuring an external PostgreSQL instance using the Helm Chart^].
====

== Installation Troubleshooting

The following are some problems you could see during installation, and the potential fix for them.

. *Problem*: The `rhdh-developer-hub` pod is stuck in a `CrashLoopBackOff` error with the following seen in the logs:
+
```
Loaded config from app-config-from-configmap.yaml, env
...
2023-07-24T19:44:46.223Z auth info Configuring "database" as KeyStore provider
type=plugin
Backend failed to start up Error: Missing required config value at
'backend.database.client'
```
+
*Solution*: This is happening because the configuration files are not being appropriately accessed by the RHDH container. You may have edited the helm chart values before installation, and one or more attributes are missing or configured incorrectly. It is recommended to keep the default values (except for the wildcard DNS name of the OpenShift cluster) during installation.
+
You can always edit and update the RHDH configuration after the installation is completed successfully.

. *Problem*: I see the following error when installing the RHDH helm chart using the *helm* CLI:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
Error: query: failed to query with labels: secrets is forbidden: User "system:anonymous" cannot list resource "secrets" in API group "" in the namespace "devhub"
----
+
*Solution*: Ensure that you are logged in to the OpenShift cluster as a cluster administrator before installing, removing or upgrading the RHDH helm chart. Also ensure that you are in the correct OpenShift project, so that the resources are created in it.
